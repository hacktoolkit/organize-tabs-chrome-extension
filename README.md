# Organize Tabs Google Chrome Extension

This plugin enables the following operations:

- **Collate Tabs** - Groups all of your tabs into separate windows, grouped by hostname, and sorted by URL. Ignores windows with pinned tabs.
- **Consolidate Tabs** - Combines all tabs across all windows into one window, sorted by URL. Ignores windows with pinned tabs.
- **Deduplicate Tabs** - Enumerates through all tabs, and keeps only the first copy of a tab with a unique URL, and closes the remaining tabs with duplicate URLs. Recommend running this *after* running **Collate Tabs**.
- **Sort Tabs in Window** - Sorts tabs in current window by URL
- **Close Blank Tabs** - Closes all blank tabs
